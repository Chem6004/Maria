- Submission on time: Yes -> 100%
- Question 1: 13/20 (numerical error in part a, part b needs explanation)
- Question 2 10/20 (potential used is still the potential from the computational lab, not the problem set)
- Question 3 15/20 (Hamiltonian is missing 2-electron repulsion term for Hartree product)
- Question 4 18/20 (Small numerical error in the expectation value)
- Question 5 20/20 
- Cumulative Accuracy for questions:  76%
- Final Grade for Orientation is 1/2(On Time + Accuracy) = 88%
